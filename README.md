# 90-Day Confidence Training

## Introduction
This project, "90-Day Confidence Training", is centered around a simple yet powerful concept. The aim is to supercharge your self-confidence over a period of three months.

## How It Works
Each day for 90 days, you'll challenge yourself to list 100 things that you are completely sure you can accomplish, with no repeats. These tasks span a wide spectrum, from the mundane like tying shoelaces neatly to more aspirational goals such as reading 20 pages of a self-help book. The focus is on actions that are within your immediate reach.

## Why It Helps
By constantly identifying and achieving these small victories, you reprogram your mind to believe in your abilities. You'll start noticing patterns of success, which chips away at self-doubt and builds a solid foundation of self-assurance. It's like a daily workout for your confidence muscle.
